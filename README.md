# GEO468E Course - Jupyter Notebook Application
This repository contains documentation and code for Normalized Difference Salinty Index application via Jupyter Notebook within this course.

***

## Images to Analyse
Within the scope of this project, necessary images those are sensed and produced by Landsat 5(TM) are obtained from USGS Earth Explorer. 

***

## Normalized Difference Salinity Index(NDSI)
Normalized Difference Salinity Index is used to determine the salinity situation of soil. NDSI is calculated by the formula:

- (SWIR1-SWIR2)/(SWIR1+SWIR2) for Landsat 4-5 images.

***

## Spectral Bands for Landsat 5(TM)
- **Band 1** - Blue
- **Band 2** - Green
- **Band 3** - Red
- **Band 4** - Near Infrared
- **Band 5** - Short-wave Infrared-1
- **Band 6** - Thermal Infrared
